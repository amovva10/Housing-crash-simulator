This project aims to explore U.S. housing market risk under different economic shocks.  
(Findings will be added here as the analysis progresses.)

---

## Features
Planned functionality:
- This app will forecast **Home Price Index (HPI)** with ML models  
- It will simulate **“what-if” scenarios** (e.g., interest rates +2%, unemployment spikes, inventory changes)  
- It will estimate **crash probability** under stress scenarios  
- It will include an interactive **Streamlit app** for exploration
